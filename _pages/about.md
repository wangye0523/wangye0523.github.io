I am currently a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.cqupt.edu.cn/) since March. 2020. My primary research interest is generative artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and multimodal learning. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) in 2019, along with a full scholarship. I have also worked in companies such as [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/) and [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/). I have been the Principal Investigator (PI) of various research projects, such as [the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scientists](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/)ÔºàÂõΩËá™ÁÑ∂ÈùíÂπ¥È°πÁõÆÔºâ.

For detailed research papers, please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UNxKb0cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  <br />  For the Chinese version of my curriculum vitae, please refer to my [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà‰∏™‰∫∫‰∏ªÈ°µ](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/wangye/zh_CN/index.htm).
