<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.cqupt.edu.cn/) since March. 2020. My primary research interest is generative artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and multimodal learning. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) in 2019, along with a full scholarship. I have also worked in companies such as [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/) and [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/), participating in projects related to AI in 5G. 

Since returning to China in 2020, I have been the principal investigator (PI) of various research projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scientists, the Chongqing Municipal Innovation Support Program for Overseas Returned Scholars, and the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission. 

For detailed research papers, please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UNxKb0cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  <br />  For the Chinese version of my curriculum vitae, please refer to my [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà‰∏™‰∫∫‰∏ªÈ°µ](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/wangye/zh_CN/index.htm).
