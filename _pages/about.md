I am a faculty member in the Computer Science Department at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My primary research focus is on natural language processing and multimodal fusion. With eight years of experience in the United States, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) in 2019, along with a full scholarship. I also have worked in companies such as [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/) and [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/), participating in projects related to AI in 5G. 

Since returning to China in 2020, I have been the principal investigator (PI) of various research projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scientists, the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission's research program for returnees' entrepreneurship and innovation support, and projects funded by the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission.
